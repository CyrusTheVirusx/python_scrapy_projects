You may want to go through and comment the code, because I haven't at all. I'll try to get in the habit of doing that.
If you can follow my logic with comments I think we have a decent start to the crawler. 

I was trying to get the crawler to go a link deeper and extract the description of a post on CL. Haven't gotten it to work
